The library file must be downloaded and saved inside Arduino library file before uploading user's code

# Add Library 
STEP 1 : Download the library file (Arduino_LCD-I2C_Library and Arduino_LCD-SPI_Library)

STEP 2 : Put the downloaded files in Arduino library folder separately [Documents > Arduino > libraries]

If the libraries are there, then you are ready to use it.

# Import LCD I2C
- Import lcd_i2c library
'#include <lcd_i2c.h>'
